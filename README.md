You can drag&drop scrollbar or touch empty field to move it quick. Page is drawed thru Sprite.
Bar at top of screen is mockup for future main menu, also bars are only for testing purpose. 
Values are hardcoded for 320x480 screen (in portrait mode).

Hardware used: Raspberry Pi Pico, Waveshare 3.5" 480x320 screen
